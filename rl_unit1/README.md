# Random Notes
- environment.yml is global (saved via anaconda). I'm not a big fan.. I like the idea of pipenv/pipfiles more. I, for example, don't want to make many environments, because the environments include complex things like big pytorch/CUDA dependencies. So I end up wanting to share them. Hmm.. and anaconda doesn't play well with pip (the docs are hesitant about it).
